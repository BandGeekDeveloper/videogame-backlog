# Videogame Backlog

Do you have a lot of videogames you want to play in your library but you haven't really had a chance due to being busy with other video games? Well we have a fix for that in this video game backlog. As a user you can import the video games you have and set reminders to play those games. You can also keep track of your progress and the choices that you made. Time to make forgetting about videogames a thing of the past.
